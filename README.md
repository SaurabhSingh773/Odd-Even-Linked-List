# Odd-Even-Linked-List
This Java solution reorders a singly linked list by placing nodes at odd indices first, followed by nodes at even indices. The purpose of the oddEvenList method is to group all nodes located at odd indices followed by all nodes at even indices, preserving the relative order within each group.
